## Course Project: Getting and Cleaning Data

### Introduction

This project consist on collect, clean and pepare tidy data tha can be used for later analysis.
The data provided consists on data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

### Objetives

We need to prepare a R script that performs the following analysis
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Contents
The contents of this repository are:

* tidy_data.txt: the result of the tidy data containg for each subject and activity the mean of each variable measured.
* run_analysis.R: the R script that performs the analysis, the output is *tidy _ data.txt*.
* CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
* README.md: This file.

### Requirements
- The data should be as in the data file provided in the course with the same tree structure
- Some aditional libraries are used: plyr, dplyr
